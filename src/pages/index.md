      I love making ideas come to life instantaneously
      and building things that make peoples' lives better.
      The interactivity and portability of progressive web applications
      enables this possibility.

      My current project, RealNumberz, is a PWA that I built for passive
      real estate investors to track, manage, and analyze their portfolio
      and underlying assets at-a-glance from anywhere in the world.

          Sometimes an app isn't necessary. I view web design as my artform that
          has both form and function. Custom WordPress development allows me 
          to build and deploy sites that the average person can maintain.

          I also enjoy helping people reach out to the world

          I believe in the old "teach a man to fish" adage but, more importantly, I
          believe in giving back what I've been given. I've learned a lot
          over many years and from many different sources, so I aim to distill that
          information for prospective programmers.
        title: |-
          And sharing the knowledge I've been given

          Open source code has made what I've accomplished possible. The work of complete
          strangers has enabled me to create applications and components that I, likely,
          wouldn't have been able to with my limited time. Wherever possible, I try to
          identify opportunities and share code in hopes that I can make the programming
          experience a little easier and a little better for someone out there.

          And, when possible, sharing the code itself
