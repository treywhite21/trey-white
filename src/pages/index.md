      I love making ideas come to life instantaneously
      and building things that make peoples' lives better.
      The interactivity and portability of progressive web applications
      enables this possibility.

      My current project, RealNumberz, is a PWA that I built for passive
      real estate investors to track, manage, and analyze their portfolio
      and underlying assets at-a-glance from anywhere in the world.

          Sometimes an app isn't necessary. I view web design as my artform that
          has both form and function. Custom WordPress development allows me 
          to build and deploy sites that the average person can maintain.

          I also enjoy helping people reach out to the world

          I believe in the old "teach a man to fish" adage but, more importantly, I
          believe in giving back what I've been given. I've learned a lot
          over many years and from many different sources, so I aim to distill that
          information for prospective programmers.
        title: |-
          And sharing the knowledge I've been given

          Open source code has made what I've accomplished possible. The work of complete
          strangers has enabled me to create applications and components that I, likely,
          wouldn't have been able to with my limited time. Wherever possible, I try to
          identify opportunities and share code in hopes that I can make the programming
          experience a little easier and a little better for someone out there.

          And, when possible, sharing the code itself

          I'm a huge stand-up fan whether Netflix or in-person. My favorite comedians are
          Brian Regan, Nate Bargatze, Dan Soder, Todd Barry, Kumail Nanjiani, Dimitri Martin,
          Dave Chapelle, John Mulaney, and Hannibal Burress.

          I love dogs more than humans. I've grown up with golden retrievers. We currently have
          three, and I dogsit/walk others' dogs using the Rover app.

          I enjoy art which is difficult to say without sounding pretentious, so I'll clarify&#58;
          I can appreciate artwork in the Louvre, but I truly enjoy Banksy, some street artist I
          saw in the Bahamas ten years ago, and many tattooists (though I have none myself).

          Though vague and possibly more cliche than my love for dogs, I like the water. I grew up
          spending much of my time on/in the Potomac river between Virginia and Maryland trying to
          jump boat wakes on an old SeaDoo.

          I was captain of my high school's lacrosse team and it will always be my first love...
          but I hung up my cleats and keep my head out of the glory days now by playing tennis
          or yelling at the TV while watching my fantasy football teams.

          A more recent interest of mine over the past couple of years has been focused personal development which has been fueled by Audible and Medium. I send chapter summaries and commentary in weekday emails which I plan to post for the public at some point.
